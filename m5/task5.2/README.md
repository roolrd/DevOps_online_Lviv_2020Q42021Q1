### Task 2.  

#### 1. /etc/passwd and /etc/group  

```
[ruslan@cnt7 ~]$ cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin
..................................
ruslan:x:1000:1000:Ruslan Riznyk,Home:/home/ruslan:/bin/bash
```
Structure of lines /etc/passwd:  
- username
- password
- numeric identifier of the user account (UID)
- numeric identifier of the group to which the user belongs
- text description (comments) of the user
- the location of the user's HOME directory
- the default user's command interpreter  

```
[ruslan@cnt7 ~]$ cat /etc/group
root:x:0:
bin:x:1:
daemon:x:2:
............
ruslan:x:1000:
```

Structure of lines /etc/group:
- group name
- group password
- numeric group identifier (GID)
- a list of user accounts that belong to the group  

On Linux are real users (people), which can sign in to the system, and pseudo-users (daemons, services), which can't login to the system.  There are such pseudo-users - bin, daemon, shutdown, which usually have UID in range 1-999, don't have password and commant interpreter.  

#### 2. UID  
UID range, as usual - 0 to 65535. UID - "user identifier" on the Unix-like OS, a number that is used to identify the user on the system and to determine which system resources the user can access. We can define it using the 'id'-command and on the file /etc/passwd.  
q
#### 3. GID  
It's a numeric "group identifier" on the Unix-like OS. We can define GID of specific group using the file /etc/group (section #3 of each line).  

#### 4. How to determine belonging of user to the specific group  
We can use "id" and "groups". For example:
```
id -Gn <specific username>
groups <specific username>
```
We can also look on the file /etc/group  

#### 5. Adding a user to the system  
```
sudo useradd -m(add home-directory) <specific username>
sudo adduser <specific username>
```

#### 6. How do I change the name (account name) of an existing user?  
```
sudo usermod -l <new username> <username>
```

#### 7. What is skell_dir?  
It's a "template" of structure and content user-home-directory when new user is created. Fles and subdirectories from /etc/skel directory will be copied into /home/<new user> directory.
Structure of /etc/skel directory on ubuntu 16.04:  
```
drwxr-xr-x 103 root root 4096 Jan 14 16:21 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 root root  220 Aug 31  2015 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--   1 root root 3771 Aug 31  2015 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--   1 root root  655 Jul 12  2019 .profile
```
almost the same structure in other Linux  

#### 8. How to remove a user from the system (including his mailbox)?  
```
userdel -r <username>
deluser --remove-all-files <username>
```

#### 9. What commands and keys should be used to lock and unlock a user account?  

LOCK
```
usermod -L(--lock) <username>
or
passwd -l <username>
or
usermod -s /sbin/nologin
```

UNLOCK  
```
usermod -U(--unlock) <username>
or
passwd -u <username>
or
usermod -s /sbin/bash (or another shell)
```

#### 10. How to remove a user's password?  
```
sudo passwd -d <username>
```

#### 11. Display the extended format of information about the directory
```
[ruslan@cnt7 .ssh]$ ls -la
total 8
drwx------ 2 ruslan ruslan   38 Jan 23 10:42 .
drwx------ 3 ruslan ruslan  124 Jan 19 16:47 ..
-rw------- 1 ruslan ruslan 1675 Jan 23 10:42 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 ruslan ruslan  397 Jan 23 10:42 id_rsa.pub
```
- "total 8" - total file size on the directory (kB)
- first symbol "d" or "-" - file type: "d" - directory, "-" - regular file
- "rwx------" - the permissions granted to the owner of the file(1st triade), users who are members of the owner's group (2nd triade), to everyone else(3rd triade)
- number of hard links to the file
- name of the file owner
- name the file owner's group
- file size (bytes)
- date and time of last file access
- file name. "." - current directory, ".." - parent directory  

#### 12 & 13 What access rights exist and for whom (i. e., describe the main roles)? What is the sequence of defining the relationship between the file and the user?   
"rwx | rw- | r--"  
- r - read: the contents of the file may be read
- w - write: the contents of the file may be changed
- x - execute: The file may be executed (a program or a script)  
First triade - the permissions granted to the owner of the file (it's, usually, user who created the file).   Second - the permissions granted to users who are members of the owner's group. 
Third - the permissions granted to everyone else.  

There are also 3 additional permissions bits - the set-user-ID (s), set-group-ID (s), and sticky (t) bits
- s - set-user-id (SUID) - when a user executes a file, the program is run based on the permissions of the file owner. Set-group-ID (SGID) - the execution of the program is based on the group permissions of the file. For a directory, the directory group is used as the default group for new files created in the directory.
- t - sticky bit makes it possible to create a directory that is shared by many users, who can each create and delete their own files in the directory but canâ€™t delete files owned by other users  

#### 14. What commands are used to change the owner of a file (directory), as well as the mode of access to the file?  

- changing of the file owner (and file owner's group) - command "chown"
```
[ruslan@cnt7 test]$ ls -l file1.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 ruslan ruslan 5 Jan 23 13:32 file1.txt

[ruslan@cnt7 test]$ sudo chown user2 file1.txt
[ruslan@cnt7 test]$ ls -l file1.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user2 ruslan 5 Jan 23 13:32 file1.txt

#change both owner and group
[ruslan@cnt7 test]$ sudo chown user1.user2 file1.txt
#or
sudo chown user1:user2 file1.txt
[ruslan@cnt7 test]$ ls -l file1.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user2 user1 5 Jan 23 13:32 file1.txt

#change group only
[ruslan@cnt7 test]$ sudo chown :ruslan file1.txt
[ruslan@cnt7 test]$ ls -l file1.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user2 ruslan 5 Jan 23 13:32 file1.txt
```

- changing of the file owner's - command "chgrp"
```
ruslan@cnt7 test]$ ls -l file2.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 ruslan ruslan 6 Jan 23 13:32 file2.txt

[ruslan@cnt7 test]$ chgrp wheel file2.txt
[ruslan@cnt7 test]$ ls -l file2.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 ruslan wheel 6 Jan 23 13:32 file2.txt

[ruslan@cnt7 test]$ sudo chgrp user1 file2.txt
[ruslan@cnt7 test]$ ls -l file2.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 ruslan user1 6 Jan 23 13:32 file2.txt
```

- changing mode access to the file - command "chmod"
```
